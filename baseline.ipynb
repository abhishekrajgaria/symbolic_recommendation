I am truly disappointed when I first used it. First, I had a real hard time putting this together. As a single 60 something year old woman, I had to painstakingly, reading instructions, try to put this together by myself. I guess I was hoping I could just open the box and 'pop' open the playpen. Instead, I had to put a load of pipe like pieces together and then string the netting and pace over it. After finally getting it together, I was ready to try the new puppy in there. The puppy was not happy (of course, probably to be expected) and I found her almost able to rip the netting apart. It also did not form the strongest of a surround set up (it was kind of flimsy). My puppy had more fun trying to hide under it when she was outside of it. So, this all being said, I am not sure how it would work with a child. But, to be honest, I probably wouldn't buy it.

At the same time, the baby can see you from any side through the mesh around the fence, so the mother can feel at ease., ✨SAFETY PLAY YARD: The baby play area frame is connected with a rust-proof alloy tube and ABS joint, which is strong and stable and can bear the weight of adults without bending, the bottom is made of wear-resistant, non-slip special fabric, BPA-free and non-toxic. The fence cloth cover made of thickened sponge covers the edge of the fence. When the baby collides with the fence, it can effectively increase the buffer and reduce the damage., ✨INTIMATE DESIGN: The outer zipper door is designed to facilitate interaction with the baby. In addition, a storage bag is added to the outside of the large playpen, which is convenient for placing diapers and other items. Our fence is completely wrapped in soft cloth, there is no risk of exposed gaps and pinches, please use it with confidence!, 👶EASY ASSEMBLY: The simple and sturdy structure is convenient for your assembly and disassembly, it only takes a few minutes without any tools.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
